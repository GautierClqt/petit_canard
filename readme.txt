This code is intended to be used in the Pond game at blocky-games.com
url = https://blockly-games.appspot.com/pond-duck?lang=en

The goal is to program the yellow duck(named Donald) behavior. The objective is for Donald to win the fight!

If you want to test my code: 
1/ click on the aforementioned url
2/ in the webpage click on the javascript tab
3/ open code.txt then copy/paste the content in the javascript window
4/ click on the red "Run Program" button.

This code is far from perfect, I'm trying to improve what exist and add useful new features.
If you want to feel free to modify/improve the code but try to explain what is the improvement.
This is an exercise the main goal is to learn how to code.
